I believe this book is meant for young adults (slash teenagers), but as an ancient man myself at the ripe age of 33 I found it very engaging. It's structured in such a way to give context into each of RBG's many important involvements in the law. It will lead with a relevant case that RBG presided (or represented) and then go back in time to explain her history and reason for her eventual involvement. It's educational and fun to read.
