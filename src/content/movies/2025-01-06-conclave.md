Stunning cinematography. There were many scenes with an emphasis on white and neutral colour schemes, which caused the cardinal robes to really stand out with their bright red colour.

The scoring was sublime, perfectly timed to each moment without wasting a second. I particularly enjoyed the reliance on string instruments, which provided a powerful element of tension in key moments.

There was an emphasis on hearing the actors breathing - it was an audible window into how someone was feeling without needing to see any facial expressions. There were pivotal scenes where the only thing we can hear is breathing.
