Awesome game, totally a passion project for platform lovers like myself. Reminds me of games I'd play years ago but made with today's sensibilities (so no cheap tricks or long slogs of no checkpoints, heh). Every level stood on its own. The game length felt just right to me (about 8 hours), not too long but there's enough there to keep you interested. A lot of the Relics reminded me something you'd find in a Castlevania game (think the spinning cross, or the bone that arcs as you throw it).

Anyone who enjoys an action platformer should check out this game without a doubt. Plus Yacht Club Games are continuing to update the game - so far they've added the Plague Knight campaign which is really cool! It's a redo of the Shovel Knight base game, although with plenty of twists. Plague Knight himself plays completely differently from Shovel Knight - and to top it off the levels have been changed up to suit Plague Knight's new style. With a new story on top, it's almost like a new game - and it was totally free! Future updates will be free too!
