description: All about the takeover of American AM radio by right-wing talking heads.

I appreciated the host's occasional sense of humour, because the podcast uses real audio from some of the right-wind radio hosts and it can be... vitriolic, to put it nicely. I don't know what to do but immediately laugh after some of the hateful bile these men spew.

It amazed me how quietly it started, but much like a flamethrower (hey, just getting that now) the power of right-wind radio grew so rapidly.

Much like any number of problems facing America in the 21st century, it comes back to Reagan.
