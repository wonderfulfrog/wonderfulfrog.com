I feverishly consumed the entire Dresden series in a few years ago. I thought it was so cool to see a blend of fantasy and real life that didn't seem to exist (as far as I knew). The writing sometimes felt chauvinistic (Dresden himself even admits as much) but I would roll my eyes and plod on.

Having finally had the chance to read the next book I couldn't just roll my eyes anymore. Every single female character is always ridiculously attractive, so much so that Dresden cannot think about anything else other than sex (the Winter Mantle is a convenient albeit absolutely stupid excuse in the novel).

Every major female character is always lusting (or will lust) for Dresden. These sections read like a piece of fan fiction from a nerdy male teenager's perspective (something I would've written when I was 15). The whole White Court seems to exist just so there's an excuse to always talk about sex (especially heterosexual sex). Even worse is that Dresden (rapidly approaching grandpa years, in a human sense) will ogle and comment (privately at least) on women who are pretty close to (or are) minors.

Another fault is that characters keep referring to recent events that the reader will likely not remember. It's been several years between books, and us readers need a quick primer on the most recent goings-on in the universe!

Our resident investigator didn't do much of anything. He aimlessly stumbled around for a while until the plot plopped onto his lap. What happened to our plucky detective who went looking for clues? Who did _anything_?

Spoiler alert: The book ends on a cliffhanger. Yep, we don't get to learn about why anything happened because it's in the second book. Even though every book previously has been a nice package, we get a big middle finger. Should've waited for the anthology that will eventually combine Peace Talks and Battle Ground.

All that said, I will likely pick up Battle Ground whenever that comes out in paperback. The series has (some serious) faults, but there is _something_ to enjoy here.
