The nemesis system is such a killer feature - it's a shame that Warner Bros. patented the mechanic which prevents other games from implementing their own spin on the feature.

I was often the victim of my orcish enemies, and would often say "you again!" when I stumbled upon an old nemesis. I would drop everything to try and take them out, which was often not a good idea.
