A uniquely humanizing experience when Dylan chats with his haters. It's surprising to me how many people backtrack their comments (or at least stand by the spirit and not the delivery). I do think anonymity has this boosting effect in people's willingness to be mean (putting it lightly).

The second season puts a fun twist on the format where people with diametric viewpoints are put onto a call (consensually) to have a discussion. Sometimes minds are changed, and people seem to want to listen with good faith.

Honestly we need podcasts like this in a post-pandemic era where "us vs. them" mentality has completely dominated modern discourse online and in-person.
