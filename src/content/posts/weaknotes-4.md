Been a while since my last entry. Since then I went to Calgary again. I didn’t end up doing much this time. I was by myself for most of the trip. I underestimated how weird it feels not only being alone but in an unfamiliar place. It hit me harder than I ever expected. On the upside I managed to get work done on my site (which should be evident soon).

I got a new pair of glasses. It’s been four years since I got my last pair, and the prescription jump is not insignificant. I’m still getting used to them. My first time with progressives. I love the frames, though!

I discovered the joy of [Copic markers]. They’re fun! And gorgeous. And expensive. I’ll have to pace myself. See some quick doodles at the start of the post.
