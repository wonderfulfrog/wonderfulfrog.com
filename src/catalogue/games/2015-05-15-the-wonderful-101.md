Here's a game that cranks everything to 11... and then 11 more... _every single stage_. A game that attempts to top itself every time and succeeds wonderfully. Just when you think the game has reached the climax, you find out it's still just the rising action. Fans of titles by Platinum will feel right at home here. Expect a truly challenging game that rewards skillful play.

The line drawing mechanic can be a bit picky at times, and sometimes they got a little heavy-handed on the minigames. It has a large learning curve too. Still, this is a solid experience for any action game lover. I really enjoyed this one and I hope a sequel is in the works. Also, WONDER RED FOR SMASH
