For those wondering how the modern incel movement starting gaining so much traction - this podcast explores how the movement started and how it has got so far.

I found this podcast particularly harrowing because I heard myself in it so many times. I used to identify with the incel movement - before it had that name. At the height of Gamergate I was one of those amongst the thousands who believed the feminists were coming for my video games.

It's so easy to become radicalized because it happens so slowly - it's insidious. There are men out there ready to bring you into the fold, truly terrible and reprehensible people that "validate" your feelings but feed you hateful ideology.

I can't remember when I got out of the movement. It happened slowly if I remember right. I'd disagree with a small point, and then I found myself disagreeing more until I recognized it for what it was. Nothing but hateful rhetoric.

It can be hard for a lot of men to reach that point, though. They become so entrenched in their beliefs that they can't think rationally anymore.
