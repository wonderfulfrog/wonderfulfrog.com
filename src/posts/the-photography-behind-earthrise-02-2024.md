I've always had a fascination with space and astronomy. I hope that one day I can go there. I believe with companies like SpaceX that dream might be a reality (even if the person running the company is a bozo).

The photo in question is [this one here](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/apollo-8-earthrise/), taken during the Apollo 8 mission by Bill Anders.

The Earth is vibrant blue, with sweeping white clouds across the surface. The moon contrasts the setting with a craggy, gray surface.", "Earthrise" %}

This video by [Phil Edwards](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilEdwardsInc) goes into the weeds of how a simple photograph was achieved. I figured the story was pretty simple: an astronaut picked up the camera and snapped a pic and that was that - not so!

For instance, did you know that the cameras they used had no viewfinders (or in other words, no way to verify how the photo might come out)? The astronauts had to point their cameras in the general vicinity and hope for the best!

Or how about how the photo was originally taken at a different angle - it was rotated after the fact!

There's so much more to the story and worth your time. Especially for anyone interested in space or photography!
