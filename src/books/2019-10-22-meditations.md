Despite the accolades this book gets from self-help authors, I found it fairly dry and hard to read at times. There are great nuggets of advice buried in between meandering, lengthy passages. Thoughts are repeated often, but I can sympathize here. It's difficult to ingrain a certain way of thinking at first blush, but hammering into one's thick skull can work sometimes.

The footnotes are a helpful addition -- even translated into modern English it can be hard to tell what Marcus is _really_ saying.

I plan to revisit the book another time in my life, but as of now I haven't gleaned much after reading so many books that base their ideas on the writings here.
