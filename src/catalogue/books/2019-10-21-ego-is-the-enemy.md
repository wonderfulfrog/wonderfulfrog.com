Confirmed that I'm not the only one guilty of over-planning and under-working. The real results come from work and not planning. Focus less on preparation and dive in. Do the work. Failure is part of the process, but what is most important is how one responds to it.

Plenty of fun historical anecdotes -- kinda wish the book was mostly that. The message was clear, if a bit sanctimonious.
