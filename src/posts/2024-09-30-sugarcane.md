Today in Canada is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. It's also known as Orange Shirt Day. It is a day for listening.

For this year's day, we decided to see the documentary _[Sugarcane](https://films.nationalgeographic.com/sugarcane)_. A brief synopsis:

> An investigation into abuse and missing children at an Indian residential school ignites a reckoning on the nearby SugarcaneÂ Reserve.

What I saw was a stunning, raw, heart-wrenching story about the survivors of just one residential school. There was so much pain, so much suffering, and this all happened at just one residential school. In Canada there were over 190 of these schools, and it feels like only recently the nation is really starting to listen to the stories these survivors have to tell.

I sometimes wonder to myself "what can I do?" in situations like these. If I can affect anyone else, taking the time to see these stories and really listening and learning is one small step you can make. It's admittedly not very hard for you to do either. There might be a local cinema showing _Sugarcane_, or perhaps other movies by indigenous creators.

If you're feeling like it, you can make a donation to the [IRSSS](https://www.irsss.ca/) (Indian Residential School Survivors Society). The website also has plenty of resources if you'd like to learn more, or find out other ways you can help.
