I loved the dice system that powered the entire game. It made it feel like you have control over the situation (you can choose where to put your dice rolls), but at the same time none at all (the result is still a dice roll). I especially liked that every choice never felt like a great option. Every choice will inadvertently affect someone or something else negatively. There was never a clear-cut best choice.

I felt drawn into the universe and atmosphere, and the music provided an immersive backdrop. The music changed depending on the situation, which added another level of immersion.

A must-play for anyone who enjoys a narrative-focused game.
