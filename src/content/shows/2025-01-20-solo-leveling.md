It feels like I havenâ€™t enjoyed an anime since around 2018 (besides occasionally following _One Piece_). This is the first in a long time where I felt invested and interested!

I find the story engaging and paced well, each episode is progressing the overarching plot but with smaller stories in each episode.

My only gripe would be that the violence and gore can be excessive. I know this is a common trope in anime - but even with that in mind it tends toward gratuitous at times.
