This site is now powered by NextJS. This is the site rebuild I have been talking about for some time, but it didn‚Äôt turn out the way I was planning.

## Why NextJS?

Short answer: because I wanted to learn it.

Long answer: I wasn‚Äôt completely satisfied with the GatsbyJS ecosystem. It lead me to learn GraphQL and a little bit of Webpack, but it felt largely like a black box to me.

More recently though I read about [some troubling details][gatsby-contractor] a contractor faced while working for GatsbyJS. I was not at all impressed with how GatsbyJS handled this. Their CEO‚Äôs [empty apology in an open letter][gatsby-open-letter] reeks of ‚Äútechbro culture‚Äù to me. The whole situation is a real mess. Given that I‚Äôve personally been unsatisfied with the ecosystem, this seemed like a good time to ditch GatsbyJS in favor of something else. But what...?

For a while I toyed with the idea of making it myself, but that seemed like too much work for how little I need. I‚Äôm not that interested in tweaking every aspect of my build process. I like to find opinionated tools that align with my goals instead of making my own.

_Aside: An opinionated tool in my case is a framework or library that has opted to make some choices or ‚Äúsensible defaults‚Äù that align with how I would potentially use it. I don‚Äôt need to spend time reconfiguring everything to work how I want it to._

I tried to find some lightweight frameworks that read Markdown (or MDX) files and create HTML files from them. After reading [this post][gatsby-vs-next], I was convinced that I should try out NextJS. More importantly the post told me how NextJS worked. It made total sense to me:

- Read the files we want
- Use remark to convert them to HTML
- Build pages from that output

Done. Simple. No need to add GraphQL. Right from the get-go everything made sense to me, which I can‚Äôt necessarily say for GatsbyJS.

## What about Tailwind or Theme UI?

I previously stated that I was planning on using [TailwindCSS][tailwind] and then later [Theme UI][theme-ui] to help style my site. I ended up flitting between the two for some time before deciding that they were too heavy-handed and too complex for what I needed. It also felt like I ended up fighting with the default style, trying to remove style I didn‚Äôt like. This sounds like an opinionated tool that doesn‚Äôt align with my goals. I opted to instead do my styling by hand. I only use a small set of the standard HTML elements, so I needn‚Äôt worry about making sure every single element is styled properly. Instead I opted to:

- Set the font to something I like (in this case all system defaults)
- Set some CSS variables with a color scheme I designed
- Gradually style every element using my current content as a test
- Add some font scaling

Called it done there.

Now that I have the basic framework down, I plan to flex my developer muscles and slowly introduce some of my own character and add delight into my site. I want to make it a fun place to visit.

As much fun as a website can be, anyway. üòÑ
