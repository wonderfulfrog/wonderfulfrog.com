excerpt: The week of continuing my habit!

Short and sweet this week.

I had my first raid with my guild in _World of Warcraft_, and got to play the role of tank too! It was stressful, but I had a lot of fun too. We managed to take down a tricky boss (The Silken Court), and made a good attempt on the final one. Hoping next time we can do every boss!

## Links

Just two links this week.

## [Growth Hack](https://pxlnv.com/blog/growth-hack/)

I'll bet most folks didn't know that apps could see _all_ of their contacts when they give access.

I am thrilled by this change in iOS 18. I haven’t given an app access to my contacts since I heard about apps in general slurping up all contact data. I honestly have no sympathy for any business that has violating privacy as a requirement.

I would much prefer to give a subset of my contacts, if any at all. I still likely won’t give any access going forward because I am so mistrustful of startups.

## [The times of seeing my favourite bands live are coming to an end](https://82mhz.net/posts/2024/10/the-times-of-seeing-my-favourite-bands-live-are-coming-to-an-end/)

Getting old does seem to have its low points for sure. I get it - I'm a bit sad that I never got to see Pink Floyd live (in any form).

But as an encouraging note I'd like to say to Andreas and anyone else that there are other ways to see your favourite (but no longer touring) bands!

I don't know if this is underrated or not but tribute bands are actually fun to see. It provides a chance to see your favourite songs performed live by talented musicians. For example, local Pink Floyd tribute [PIGS](https://canadapinkfloyd.com/) does a fantastic job recreating the feel and excitement with a Pink Floyd show. They aren't just playing the songs, but bring out the full light shows (and lasers of course).

Another wonderful tribute band I saw was for Black Sabbath, including "Ozzy" biting the head off a (plastic) bat. Now that felt authentic! On top of that, I got to see it with my Dad, and that was a wonderful experience that we both got.

Facing the facts here - there is simply no way to see certain bands anymore. Tribute bands are the only solution. Don't downplay the fun that can be had - some of them really go all out!

I'm sure there's a local (or at least regional) band that pays tribute to your favourite classic rock (or whichever genre of) band. You might just have to go look for it. And of course, if you just want more music you like, [there's always ways to find it](https://www.wonderfulfrog.com/posts/music-today-is-great/)!

## Listening

I missed the most recent [Bandcamp Friday](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/) which was on the 4th - d'oh! The next one isn't until December 6th... I won't miss it this time, it's in my calendar!

A lot of new music came out on Friday as well.

We have a new [Bknapp](https://bknapp.bandcamp.com/album/snes-beats-vol-9) - revisiting his staple of SNES beats. I love seeing a new one of these come out. There's just something about the Super Nintendo's sound chips that evokes a feeling -- a mood -- so well. I love it!

Four new records from some of my favourite bands, and I haven't even listened to them yet! We have [Caribou - Honey](https://album.link/ca/i/1742019690), [Godspeed You! Black Emperor](https://album.link/i/1760821166), and [The Smile - Cutouts](https://album.link/ca/i/1758065392). Animal Collective also released a [live version of Sung Tongs](https://album.link/i/1743418801) which should be interesting! Also features some non-album tracks.

I'm looking forward to the weekend - on Saturday we are heading off to the mainland to meet up with my in-laws. I'm excited to get away and spend time together as a family! Knowing my father-in-law, he'll have a suite of activities ready for us to tackle.
