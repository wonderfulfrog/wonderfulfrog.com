This book finally made me realize what I love so much about fantasy books: the world building. The Way of Kings is no slouch in that department. The story plods along in the beginning (although not too slowly), meanwhile you learn the history of the planet Roshar and its denizens. There's the various kingdoms and cultures (which are detailed), the magic systems (yes, there's more than one!), the mythical Shardblades (and Shardplate)... so much of the world is laid out and it really draws you in. The book seems to be compared to Wheel of Time and I can see it - but it's definitely separated itself enough from its influences to really stand on its own. I'm happy to hear there's only going to be five books in the series, so hopefully Sanderson will get to finish this series.
