My completion time was somewhere around 72 hours. It's hard to talk about such a story-dense game without spoiling too much - but what I will say about the story is that it's probably one of the best I've ever experienced. The game is likely not for everyone... the playtime alone might turn some people off. I think of it more like a large book - it'll take you a while to get through - but the major plot points keep you engrossed. You get attached to the characters - because of the game length. By the end of the game they are all close friends.

Games for me don't typically get much of an emotional response out of me... I can probably count the number of times. There were moments of pretty genuine sadness (yeah yeah I teared up), and I even remember getting angry/upset at a particular story development. Any game that can accomplish that I hold in a high regard, and this is one of them.

Most of the major characters have Social Links - think lite dating-sim kinda system. This is where some of the character development takes place. As you increase your Social Links you increase the strength of that Arcana during fusions. It creates a gameplay purpose to explore the Social Links, but I genuinely wanted to explore them regardless of the gameplay purpose.

The battle system is not without its shortcomings - it feels a little unforgiving - JRPG to the very core. I still think it's goofy that if the main character is KO'd, the game ends (and there are no checkpoints). Saving often is a must. There were also a few sharp difficulty curves... I suspect my level was too low at that point, but there it is. It's kinda like Pokemon, Shadows have certain weaknesses and resistances (think fire, ice, electricity, etc), and it's up to you to abuse that. Hitting an enemy with an attack they are weak to gives that character another turn - but only if the target isn't already Down (which triggers when they are hit by an attack they are weak to), so you can't get stuck in a loop of free turns. The fun part is that the enemy has access to the same system, so if you're not careful you can get wiped out very quickly.

I can't end it without mentioning the music. Second to the story, it's top-notch, definitely some of the best I've heard in any game full stop. I have a feeling the music in a vacuum won't have the same impact as when its heard in-game. Regardless, here are a few favourites:

If you're looking for an RPG with a top-notch story, this is the one. If you're looking for one with compelling gameplay... keep looking I'd say.

I can't wait to start Persona 4 Golden, but I think I'm going to give myself a break from RPGs for a while. Next up is Shovel Knight!
