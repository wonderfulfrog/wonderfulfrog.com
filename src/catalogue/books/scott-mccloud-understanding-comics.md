I debated if this should end up in a different catalogue, but it deserves to be in both, if anything.

If you wondered just how deep the rabbit hole goes when it comes to all things comics, Scott McCloud is here to tell you it goes _deep_. Anyone who may doubt the medium of the comic -- I challenge you to come out without a new perspective reading this. I know I did. I appreciate them so much more now.

To call it "a book about comics" feels like a disservice. There is so much more going on here about history and the human mind.

I think everyone needs to read this book at some point in their lives.
