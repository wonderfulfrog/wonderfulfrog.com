I was on the hunt for what I considered "pulpy fantasy" novels, something in a fantasy setting and easily digestible.

Plenty of folks on the internet suggested R. A. Salvatore's Drizzt books, and this being chronologically (but not written) first it seemed like a natural choice.

I wasn't disappointed. I got exactly what I wanted. There is a fair bit of world building to establish the underground drow world of Menzoberranzan. I imagine for 1990 a matriarchal-based society was a radical idea. In this world it's the women who rise to the top, with the men competing for what's effectively middle-management positions.

Drizzt fits the bill of your stereotypical gifted teen, with a strong competency of melee combat thanks to his teacher Zaknafein. We learn that Drizzt struggles following the tenets of Menzoberranzan, feeling that there has to be more to the world than cruelty and violence.

It's a refreshingly straightforward story which kept me engaged and continually wanting more. I told myself that I'd only read this trilogy and that'd be it, but sure enough I can't help but wanting more Drizzt Do'Urden!
