Looking back at my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/wonderfulfrog/), I watched a total of **42** movies in 2024! Of those, **10** were movies released in 2024. Let's take a look at my favourite movies (and TV) of the year!

## Movies

I saw plenty of great movies this year, but there were a few I think that rose above the rest!

### Anatomy of a Fall

I never thought I'd be so enthralled by a courtroom drama (but then again I do love Star Trek). I couldn't stop thinking or talking about this movie for weeks.

I want to go into more detail but wouldn't dare accidentally spoil something. I highly encourage anyone who enjoys a drama to watch this. There isn't a wasted moment.

### The Wild Robot

An absolutely stunningly beautiful film. A heartwarming story. Everything about this movie made me so happy and joyful.

### Sugarcane

[I wrote about this movie](/posts/sugarcane/) a few months ago. It's had a lasting impression. Please watch it, if you can. Especially if you're Canadian.

### Perfect Days

I imagine this movie might be polarizing. When we walked out of the theatre, someone behind us said "is that it?" It's no surprise that not a lot "happens" on Perfect Days. It managed to make the mundane feel a bit magical. I was transfixed watching this movie in the theatre. I adored it. I thought about it a lot afterward. I made a playlist of the songs in the movie.

As far as movies go that I saw in 2024, this one was my favourite.

## TV

Not a lot of new TV this year! We kept with the classics. We watched the entirety of _Frasier_, and our other favourites. That said, there were two notable shows that we watched!

### Star Trek: Strange New Worlds

I didn't have a lot of hope for the future of Star Trek after watching a few episodes of Picard (I'm certain the show has its fans, it's just not for me), but seeing Strange New Worlds reignited my hope for more Star Trek. This show just _gets it right_, and I love the entire cast. My favourites are Dr. M'Benga and Christine Chapel, but I think everyone on the show is great! I was so excited to see courtroom episodes again.

### Star Trek: Lower Decks

Lower Decks!! Cerritos Strong! I loved this show so much. It was Star Trek but hilarious and fun. Amidst the chaos there were some charming and heartwarming moments. It's absolutely criminal that this show was cancelled, but I suppose a silver lining is that this show won't go on longer than it needs to. I just want a little more time with my Beta Shifters.

2024 marked the series finale and I think they went out extremely well. It's a great sendoff for our capable crew.

_Engage the core!_
