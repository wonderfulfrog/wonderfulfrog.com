A bad habit of mine is not updating my site with some new writing. After reading Tom MacWright's "[How to blog](https://macwright.org/2019/02/06/how-to-blog.html)" (and the rest of his fantastic site), I decided that I like the idea of writing on a schedule. So, I'm going to do my darnedest to makes sure I write something at least once a month. I like the title of "Recently", so I'm opting to steal that.

Living during a pandemic has been weird. My mood swings pretty rampantly -- one day I'll be happy, and the next exhausted for seemingly no reason. I'm doing my best to escape with whatever I can. Usually my hobbies.

I've been playing [Animal Crossing](https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/) a ton. The game couldn't have come at a better time, honestly. Nothing goes wrong in your deserted island. It's been a fantastic creative outlet for myself. I'm losing hours consistently reshaping my island to what my idyllic paradise would be (in this case, it's mostly a forest). Popping by to say hello to all of my villagers. Stopping to admire my myriad flower gardens. It's a great way to unwind after a long day.

I've been really enjoying [Bknapp's Nostalgic Nintendo Beats 2](https://bknapp.bandcamp.com/album/nostalgic-nintendo-beats-2) lately. Lo-fi hip-hop is on heavy rotations these days as it helps me regain focus and keeps me in a lighter mood. From Tom MacWright's blog, I discovered [Wolf Parade](https://wolfparade.bandcamp.com/), and by playing Grand Theft Auto V ([currently free on the Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/grand-theft-auto-v/home)), I found Bass Drum of Death's [Crawling After You](https://bassdrumofdeath.bandcamp.com/track/crawling-after-you).

I just finished reading Neil deGrasse Tyson's [Astrophysics for People in a Hurry](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191710-astrophysics-for-people-in-a-hurry). I found it hard to follow at times. It felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a beginner's book, or an advanced look. I have more than a passing fancy when it comes to astrophysics, but sometimes the pure information-dump was just too much. There was a lot of process, and some of it I just plain didn't get. I would still push Stephen Hawking's [A Brief History of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3869.A_Brief_History_of_Time) as a primer into the world of astrophysics (and everything in-between). Still, I feel like it serves as a great catalyst for more learning.

My partner has been encouraging me to take more photos lately. I'm trying my best to take at least one photo a day, but it's been difficult when I start to get too critical of what I'm taking a photo of. It feels like there's only so much to photograph in your neighborhood, but I'm trying to not stress too much about it and just press the shutter button. It's been really exciting to reconnect with photography again.
