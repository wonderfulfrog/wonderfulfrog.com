Fell asleep many times reading this, which I believe was part of the author's intent. Incredibly informative in regards to all things sleep. Helpful appendix to summarize the book's contents, and a useful crib sheet to give to others not willing to read the entire book. I feel empowered with new knowledge about sleep and additional reasons to ensure that I sleep more.
