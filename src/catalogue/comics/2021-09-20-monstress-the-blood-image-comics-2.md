I love the cast of the story. We are introduced to some new characters with a heavy nautical theme. Old Tooth the shark-person looks straight out of the 90s (remember Street Sharks?). The artwork continues to be the main selling point for me.

Where things falter though has to be the writing (again). There are less mysteries to track and more emphasis on character development, but I’m finding it so dense that it’s hard to follow. It practically requires a wiki open while reading. There is so much to pack into a graphic novel with limited pages. I think the series would do better as a novel if I’m completely honest.

I can’t get into the story, but Sana Takeda’s art is so phenomenal I want to keep going.
