I found it hard to follow at times. It felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a beginners or an advanced book. I have more than a passing fancy when it comes to astrophysics, but sometimes the pure information-dump was just too much. There was a lot of process, and some of it I just plain didn't get. I would still push Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time as a primer into the world of astrophysics (and everything in-between). Still, I feel like it serves as a catalyst for more learning.
