There is an obsession with finding a guru - a subject matter expert - and trying to learn from them. I should know - I spent a large part of my 20s following the advice of wealthy, privileged white men telling me how to live a fulfilling life. Just wake up a 5am, just meditate every day for 30 minutes, just just just... I hate the word "just" now and treat it like a hangnail.

Episode 3 in particular resonated with me. There are no shortage of shysters in the wellness and self-help industry promising to be your guru, but lacking in any credentials. The productivity sphere is lousy with them. There is a strange obsession with productivity in the world of white men, and few of them have any regard for someone who has a family has to deal with.
