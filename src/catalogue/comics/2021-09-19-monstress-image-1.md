The first 75% of the volume is quite confusing. It’s like reading the second or third volume in a series without reading the first. I get starting with a mystery as a hook, but when every second word is something new, I get confused!

I’m not convinced that comics are the best form of world building, at least through expository dialogue. When several entire pages that are at least half-filled with text, I think there’s a problem.

The artwork is praised often elsewhere and I must agree - every page (even panel) could stand on its own. Absolutely stunning. The world building on the visual level absolutely nails it. If atmosphere is set within the first few pages and I’m here for it.
