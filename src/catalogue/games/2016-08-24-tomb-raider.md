I feel like it did start to get a bit repetitive at times, but only near the end. Lara sure went through some shit, I felt bad sometimes. The optional tombs were really cool - one-off tricky puzzles. They were pretty short though, I think every one was just one puzzle (although I didn't find/explore them all). Something I didn't like very much was the penchant for QTEs - I hate those things. I played it on a PC and the button prompts had an icon instead of the actual button to press (if you play on console, it'll show which button to press). A minor annoyance which lead to some fails - which by the way are excruciatingly brutal sometimes! There's quite a bit of button mashing and it feels weird on a keyboard. All in all though, great game, and definitely planning on getting the next one. Probably on PS4 though.
