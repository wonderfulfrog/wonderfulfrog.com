We're on holiday, at last! The weather here is warmer than I'm used to but I'm managing. This week's and next week's posts will be light, but I'll try to keep at least a few interesting tidbits in here.

## [The state of digital music purchases in 2024](https://pcalv.es/the-state-of-digital-music-purchases-in-2024/)

> I'd argue that the streaming model has affected the public perception on the value of music. Why pay for a digital copy of an album where you can get *all the music* for the same value or less?

I noticed a similar trend when the App Store first launched. It was not uncommon to see apps priced between $5 and $30. It was a reasonable price for the hard work individual developers or teams put into their work. Over time, it became a race to the bottom with 99-cent sales. It undervalued the craft of building a piece of software. Eventually, we arrived at free apps with paid subscriptions, which feels like a parallel with modern music business models.

I wish there were a market for artists to sell their music at what price they wanted. Music has become such a commodity, why pay $10 for one album when the same price gets you all music ever released? I can’t fault anyone for taking that deal. It’s an amazing bargain. What I can blame is the music industry execs who brought us to where we are.

## [Handling Death Gracefully in Digital Experiences](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/handling-death-gracefully-in-digital-experiences/)

I've had this post in my bookmarks for a long time, but I’d like to mention it now. I think this ties in tangentially to something like accessibility. Creating the right experience for users at the right time seems crucial. The example given in the article with Eventbrite sending out cheerful invites for a celebration of life is great example that doesn't seem difficult to account for. It’s important to tailor the experience to meet people where they are at. It's important to consider what someone might be going through if an app or service might be used in times of grief or loss.

I'm looking forward to the next week. I'm hoping it's full of potential times of rest and relaxation, curling up with a book, visiting with friends and family, fun activities, and perhaps a bit of work. That last one is a big maybe.

We have a few activities in mind like visiting a local bird sanctuary, a barcade (I'm hoping to win a new hat), taking our niece to a cat cafe, VR, maybe even a drive-in movie! There's lots to be excited for.
