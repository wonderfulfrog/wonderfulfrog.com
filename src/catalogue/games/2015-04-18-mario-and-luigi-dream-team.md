Whew what a game that was. I would say the hardest M&L to date. A real full adventure. I clocked in at just under 48 hours total. All told that's a pretty good chunk of time for a portable RPG. The formula remains more or less the same as previous games - very action heavy for an RPG. You have to jump and hammer to defend yourself, while timing your button presses to coordinate with attacks. The twist this time is that you get sucked into the Dream World. The Dream World is affected by Luigi, who will lend you all sorts of cool powers as you progress in the game. This leads to two different types of battles - battles in the normal world, and Dream World battles where it's only Mario (with Luigi supporting).

The writing is spot on here, there were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments. I've found that every game so far has really expressive animations and sprites. You'll see what I mean when you play it.

Any fan of the series or someone looking for a challenging RPG can't go wrong here.
