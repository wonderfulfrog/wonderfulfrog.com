# About me

Hello! Ahoj! Welcome to my site!

My name is **Devin Haska** and this is my little slice of the internet I call home.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of topics you'll find here: web development, music, reading, video games, politics, and intersections of all of the above.

I really like frogs, like a lot. So I made myself a mascot. They don't have a name yet, but perhaps you can think of one?

## Professional

I'm currently working at [Metalab][metalab] as a Web Engineer, and I've been working here for 4 years.

I have a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Computer Science from the [University of Victoria][uvic].

Technologies I have focused on in the last few years include:

- React
- React Native
- TypeScript
- NextJS

I have a passion for the intersection of development and design. A title I associate with would be **Creative Developer**. I'm happiest when I'm at the front of the front-end, getting into nitty-gritty details with an emphasis on motion. CSS is my homebase (and yes, it's a programming language).

I try my best to champion accessibility wherever I can. I incoporate accessibility testing tools into my workflow while carrying out my day-to-day work.

## Hobbies

I tend to hop from interest to interest, fully engrossing myself and then moving on after a few weeks. That said, I do have some mainstays that I have a regular interest in, such as:

- Playing video games
- Discovering new music
- Tinkering with small electronics
- Using web dev to make things (hey, you're looking at one such thing!)
- Journaling
- Painstakingly researching the piece of gear I'm thinking about getting
- Reading
- Home DIY (building furniture, home repair and upgrades, that sort of thing)
- Making pixel art
