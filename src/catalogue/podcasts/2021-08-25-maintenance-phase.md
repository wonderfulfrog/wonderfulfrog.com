A phenomenal podcast that challenged everything I knew about fatness, dieting, food, and my own relationship with each. I don't say this lightly but it has been a life-changing revelation for me. I devour every new episode with fervor and eagerly consume all their content.

    I used to watch this show religiously with my parents. I'd look to it at times for inspiration. Realizing the literal hell the cast when through now is horrifying.
