# About me

Hello! Ahoj! Welcome to my site!

My name is **Devin Haska** and this is my little slice of the internet I call home.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of topics you'll find here: web development, music, reading, video games, politics, and intersections of all of the above.

I really like frogs, like a lot. So I made myself a mascot. They don't have a name yet, but perhaps you can think of one?

## Professional

I'm currently working for [We The Collective][wtc] as a **Front End Developer**. My previous workplace was [Metalab][metalab] as a **Web Engineer** for almost 5 years.

I have a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Computer Science from the [University of Victoria][uvic].

Technologies I have focused on in the last few years include:

- React
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Next.js

I have a passion for the intersection of development and design. There are a few titles[^1] I've seen tossed around that I feel represent myself:

- Creative Developer
- Design Technologist
- Design Engineer
- Web Designer

As a _creative web design engineer technologist_, I enjoy being in the middle of design and development, and bridge the gap between the two disciplines. I have enough design knowledge to know how an experience should look and feel, and the engineering skills to execute that vision.

I'm happiest when I'm at the front of the front-end, getting into nitty-gritty details with an emphasis on motion. CSS is my home base (and yes, it's a programming language).

I try my best to champion accessibility wherever I can. I incorporate accessibility testing tools into my workflow while carrying out my day-to-day work.

## Hobbies

I tend to hop from interest to interest, fully engrossing myself and then moving on after a few weeks. That said, I do have some mainstays that I have a regular interest in, such as:

- Playing video games
- Discovering new music
- Tinkering with small electronics
- Using web dev to make things (hey, you're looking at one such thing!)
- Journaling
- Painstakingly researching the piece of gear I'm thinking about getting
- Reading
- Home DIY (building furniture, home repair and upgrades, that sort of thing)
- Networking (as in the Internet kind) (I use a lot of UniFi products)
- Making pixel art
