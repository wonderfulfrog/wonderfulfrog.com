I'm sorry in advance (or perhaps it's too late) if I broke your RSS reader. I've been switching hosting platforms, and did not configure my deployment script correctly. It built the site as if I'd been developing locally, so all the URLs got borked in my various feed templates.

I've since fixed the issue, but you'll probably see a bunch of the same posts come up as new in your RSS reader. I'm sorry! It won't happen again.
