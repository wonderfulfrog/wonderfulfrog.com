May 8th was my last day at Metalab.

I'll miss my colleagues the most. I loved being able to work with so many talented people. I was surrounded by some very smart Engineers that I learned a lot from.

It's been almost 2 weeks. Since then, I've tried to take care of myself and not focus too hard (yet) on the job hunt. I've shored up my resume, reached out to some folks on [LinkedIn][linkedin], and talked to a lot of people. Lots of good talking.

I'm doing okay. We'll be okay. I'm looking for the next chapter and seeing plenty of opportunities out there.

I'm reminded of some old Flash cartoons from the 2000s. If you'll excuse me, I need to go eat some [fudge stripe cookies][cartoons].[^1]
