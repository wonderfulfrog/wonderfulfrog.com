Made me consider trying a keto diet before talking to friends and colleagues who had done the same and every single one had advised against it. Good ideas on paper but I think the diet that is ultimately recommended is unsustainable, which seems to go against the book's message in regards to diets -- find something that can be maintained.

Diet aside, there is lots of educational content here. Enjoyed for that reason primarily.
