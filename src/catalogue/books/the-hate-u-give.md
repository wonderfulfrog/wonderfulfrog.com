A gripping tale. Especially chilling given the current events happening at the time surrounding George Floyd when I read the book. I could not put this book down and read it at virtually any opportunity. It challenged every previously held belief I had about race and the struggles that black people face every day.

I've recommended this book to everyone and will continue to do so. I think it's a book that everyone should read, especially white people.
