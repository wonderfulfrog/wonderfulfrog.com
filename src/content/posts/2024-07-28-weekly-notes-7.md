Apologies for missing last week's notes. We just got back from vacation, and I was exhausted.

Our trip was a ton of fun. One of my highlights was getting to go kayaking for the first time ever. My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we are looking into getting kayaks for ourselves. We got lots of family connection and spending time with friends. I didn't end up winning that hat though, because I severely underestimated how many points I needed. Yes, I could've bought one… but that's not the point!

I also started my new job! Yes, I am employed again! I'm working as a Front End Developer. I received the job offer letter during our trip which was a nice surprise! I started on the 23rd, so my first week is finished. A lot of new stuff to digest, meeting lots of new people, but I'm excited to really sink my teeth into some projects soon!

This week has been a busy one for me, so this post will be a shorter one.

## Listening

Did you catch the Opening Ceremonies for this year's Olympics? I didn't catch it live, but learned afterward about the performance by _Gojira_. I had never heard of the band prior to this event, but consider me a fast fan. I want to share a video but can't find a decent source right now. If you feel like searching hard enough I'm sure it's out there.

Right before we left I learned about _Crosses_ (stylized as †††), which is a side project of _Deftones'_ Chino Moreno. I love _Deftones_, but I think I love _Crosses_ even more? The vibe is so perfect to me. It's that moody, sort of industrial rock, sort of post-punk vibe. A bit less aggressive than _Deftones_, but Chino's vocals are so killer. I just wish they had more albums!

## Watching

We caught a showing of _Robot Dreams_ this weekend at our little community theatre. What a charming, heartwarming, touching, and poignant movie. I think it's an incredible feat it managed to evoke so many emotions without any dialogue.

The song "September" by _Earth, Wind & Fire_ does some heavy lifting in this movie, becoming an adorable cornerstone of Dog and Robot's relationship.

I had a lot of fun looking for all sorts of 80s references and enjoyed the unique character designs. The world of _Robot Dreams_ felt so alive and vibrant.

Highly recommend for anyone.

## This Week

I'm looking forward to getting into some project work soon at work. There are some really cool things in the pipeline that I hope I can share in the future!

At home, we've been figuring out how we can tackle our storage rooms and clear out some things to make room for our incoming kayaks. This week we'd like to try and tackle it gradually.

I just ordered a bunch of networking gear (rack mounts, organizational tools, that sort of thing) to get our home networking locked in. I'll have to run new cable in our place to make it work, which will be a lot of work. But I love these kinds of projects and I'm looking forward to it. We should also be getting a new provider hookup this week, which is exciting for me!

Lots to look forward to.
