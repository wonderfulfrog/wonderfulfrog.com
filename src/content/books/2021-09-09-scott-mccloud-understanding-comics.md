If you wondered just how deep the rabbit hole goes when it comes to all things comics, Scott McCloud is here to tell you it goes _deep_. Anyone who may doubt the medium of the comic -- I challenge you to come out without a new perspective reading this. I know I did. I appreciate them so much more now.

To call it "a book about comics" feels like a disservice. There is so much more going on here about history and the human mind.

I think everyone needs to read this book at some point in their lives.
