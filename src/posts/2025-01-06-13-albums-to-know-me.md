I saw a similar post from [Jon Dueck](https://jondueck.ca/journal/2024/bakers-dozen/) that encouraged me to make my own version of this. True to the intent, I'm likely going to regret this post the moment I hit publish. Forcing myself to come up with my top 13 right now, that I can think of off the top of my head.

1. Pink Floyd - *Wish You Were Here*
2. The Beaches - *Late Show*
3. David Bowie - *Station to Station*
4. MF DOOM - *MM..FOOD*
5. blink-182 - *Take Off Your Pants And Jacket*
6. Crosses - *Crosses*
7. Bill Evans - *Undercurrent*
8. Paramore - *Riot!*
9. Softcult - *See You in the Dark*
10. Dear Rogue - *Lonesome High*
11. Innver-vation - *Movements*
12. A Tribe Called Quest - *People's Instinctie Travels And the Paths of Rhythm*
13. Porcupine Tree - *Fear of a Blank Planet*

I already regret this!! I want to change it. But I won't.

I'll revisit this later in the year and see if things change? That'll be fun!
