For an Assassin's Creed game, Black Flag is pretty solid. I was positive I was going to hate the ship parts of the game based on what I played in 3 a year or two back - but actually it's a ton of fun and flows super well. They really nailed the controls on it. There's a good balance of naval and land-based missions to keep things interesting. The game started off very similar to 3 which had my eyes rolling from the get-go, but thankfully things play out much differently.

It also helps when the protagonist is likable - Connor was just pretty flat overall, but Edward strikes me as a swashbuckling balance of Ezio and Altair - much better character.

I'd have to rank the Assassin's Creed games as follows:

1) ACII
2) AC: Brotherhood
3) ACIV: Black Flag
4) Assassin's Creed
5) ACIII
6) AC: Revelations
