I played this game with my wife and a buddy, and we had a great time getting sucked into this game. We beat it in one night. The way the story unfolded made you really feel like a detective - connecting leads and loose connections to form a whole narrative. The keyword search is very limiting. There are only at most 5 results per search query. It requires you to be specific but not too much. It's a fine line to walk.

It's very possible to finish this one in an evening, which is a great way to wind down the day and enjoy a great story.
