This book in combination with the [Maintenance Phase](http://www.maintenancephase.com) podcast has flipped my mindset when it comes to my relationship with my body. I previously believed that weight was something we all had complete control over and could change with diet and exercise. Anyone who was overweight was not trying hard enough.

I’ve come to realize that I was incredibly wrong about this.

I think now I’m fine as I am. I’ll likely never be happy with my body (but I’ll try my best), but I can at least accept that the way I look is… the way I look. It’s who I am. I should not feel ashamed for looking the way I do.

I don’t want to turn this into a self-flagellation session, but wanted to highlight how I personally felt when reading this book. It brought my lack of understanding when it comes to our bodies and weight. There is a lot of bias built into me from years of being told that “fat = early death”, even though that isn’t (and wasn’t) true. The science behind dieting suggests that most people who lose weight while dieting will eventually regain it. Our bodies want to stay at a set weight, and we cannot control that.

This book together with the podcast has brought to my attention how far the world has to go when it comes to fat acceptance. We are making incredible strides to accept people regardless of skin-colour, sexual preferences, perceived gender… but there exists anti-fat bias in all their respective circles. I want to be part of the change that says “being fat is not a death sentence.” If I can leave you with one small fact to prove that anti-fat bias exists: how about that in 48 of the 50 US states, it’s legal to deny someone a job because of their weight? Deny them housing, or a seat at a restaurant, or a room in a hotel? All legal.
