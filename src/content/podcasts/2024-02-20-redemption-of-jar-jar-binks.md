description: Quite possibly the target of the first online hate campaign - what happened to Jar Jar Binks before and after the movies released?

The interviews with Ahmed Best in particular are wonderful. I'm ashamed that I was once a part of the online hate brigade that targeted their ire toward Jar Jar. It's so easy to forget that there is a human behind the CGI - a human behind the character.

There's a ton of Star Wars history for a Star Wars fan to enjoy, but it's a story that anyone would be encouraged to hear. Dylan Marron is a fantastic host for the show.
