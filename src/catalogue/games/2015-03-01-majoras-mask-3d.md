What a wonderful game. I'll say right now if anyone hasn't played this game, you've gotta pick it up right away! One of the most (if not the most) unique Zelda experiences out there. It's worth noting that Nintendo did change things around, most notably some locations of items and the boss fights. This should only bother veterans really (and only the item location part really), but I have to say the boss fights are improved across the board compared to the N64 version. I've heard mentions that the hints in the Bomber's Notebook are too obvious now but I think that's just some oldschool vets (read: stupid fanboys) making a big fuss over nothing. Unless I specifically remembered something from playing it years ago, I feel like it never gave you the whole picture and you had to suss out what to do. Overall it's a fantastic game and a must-buy for any 3DS owner.
