Frogs are undoubtedly my favorite animal, and seeing a short film about them beings me so much joy. The tadpole is not a stage in a frog's life you see emphasized much. Not to mention this was filmed right in my beautiful province!

As the thumbnail shows this short film was won many accolades, and not without merit. Truly some of the best underwater filming I've ever seen, and even above land! Treat yourself to the sweetest 8 minutes of your day.
